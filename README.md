# EveryRFC

EveryRFC lets you instantly search titles and keywords from the [RFC
series](https://rfc-editor.org/), and explore tagged collections of RFCs. Its mission is to make it
easier to find appropriate RFCs, both for IETF "insiders" and for the general public.

Collections of RFCs are added and maintained using new issues; see our [contribution
guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
